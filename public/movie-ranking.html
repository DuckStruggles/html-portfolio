<h1>Some of the best movies I have watched</h1>
<h2>Movie Review and Rating</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ludo</h3>
<h4>9.6/10</h4>
It's an Indian romcom movie that I absolutely loved and is now my comfort movie for when I feel like watching something lighthearted
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<h4>9.9/10 The only sad part was that it ended</h4>
Being a space junkie I had to love this absolute gem, easily one of the best movies I have watched
<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<h4>9.2/10</h4>
I know it is not a movie... but anyway, a must watch for thriller lovers!
